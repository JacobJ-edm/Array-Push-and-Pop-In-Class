# Array Push and Pop In Class
A follow along instruction for using Push and Pop with JavaScript Arrays.

In todays class we will:
- Create arrays from scratch and print them to the console.
- Look at what happens to array indices when we push, pop, shift, and unshift
- Push vs assigning a value at the last index, unshift vs trying to put an element at the -1 index
- Look at what happens when we create an array with only pushes
- Look at what happens when we create an array with only unshifts
- Look at what happens if we try to push or unshift nothing
- Look at what happens when we try to shift or pop an empty array
- Look at what happens when we re-assign an array
